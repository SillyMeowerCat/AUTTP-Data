# AUTTP SCRAPER + DATA

## Overview
The UTTP (UTube Troll Police) were originally a group of people who would work together to extenguish YouTube Trolls. However over time the group devolved into a group of doxxers and groomers. **The AUTTP Scraper** is a Python-Based Tool designed for the automated identification of these cyber-criminals. Its main purpose is to be called by my other script that mass-reports UTTP Members channels, comments, and replies. The data can also be called and pulled by other AUTTP Scripts. The data.json file is updated Daily if any new UTTP Channels are found.
